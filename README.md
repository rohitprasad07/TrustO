#Problem Statement: Incentivizing Environment-Conscious Customers
As consumer awareness about climate change grows, there is a noticeable shift towards adopting environmentally sustainable consumption patterns. The choices individuals make in their everyday lives—ranging from energy use to transportation—directly impact the success of national climate goals. For instance, India's goal to become net-zero by 2070 heavily relies on the collective green choices of its citizens.

However, despite the increasing demand for sustainability, financial institutions currently offer limited rewards or incentives that encourage consumers to make environmentally responsible decisions. Banks, in particular, are in a unique position to influence this shift by integrating climate-conscious behavior into their financial products and services.
